# Leapmotion-Controller

This project takes your x,y,z axis values through \nuse of the Leap Motion and replicated the mouse driver along with various human actions that could be done through gestures done causing a robot (java.awt.Robot) to do various things (i.e. press a key). Below are the various standard instructions. 

Based on what application you \ndirected youself to from the original \"GUI\",\nmore specific commands are prompted when \napplication is opened if needed.

STANDARD CONFIG:
Right Hand:
Circle (Clockwise) = Left Click
Circle (Counterclockwise) = Right Click 
Screen-tap = Caps Lock
Swipe = Scroll Up
Key-tap = Windows-Button Pressed

Left Hand:
Circle (Clockwise) = Q-Button Pressed
Circle (Counterclockwise) = W-Button Press
Screen-tap = E-Button Pressed
Swipe = R-Button Pressed
Key-tap = D-Button Pressed

The file locations are set to my personal computer and can be changed in the gui.java, though I did plan to add a dropbox menu for this eventually.
